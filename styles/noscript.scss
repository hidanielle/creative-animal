// Sometimes you need to hide an element on page load, then later show it via
// Javascript. Unfortunately, if the user has Javascript disabled then they'll
// never see the element. One way around this is to hide the element in your
// main CSS file and create a seperate "noscript.css" file which shows the
// element again when the user has Javascript disabled.

#hidden-element {
  display: block;
